Fluid Behavior Tree is used through [Unity's Package Manager](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CustomPackages.html). In order to use it you'll need to add the following lines to your `Packages/manifest.json` file. After that you'll be able to visually control what specific version of Fluid Behavior Tree you're using from the package manager window in Unity. This has to be done so your Unity editor can connect to NPM's package registry.

```json
{
  "scopedRegistries": [
    {
      "name": "NPM",
      "url": "https://registry.npmjs.org",
      "scopes": [
        "com.fluid"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "dependencies": {
    "com.fluid.behavior-tree": "2.2.0"
  }
}
```

Archives of specific versions and release notes are available on the [releases page](https://github.com/ashblue/fluid-behavior-tree/releases).
